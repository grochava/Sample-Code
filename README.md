# Sample-Code
The purpose of this repository is to hold a publicly available sample of the various coding assignments I've done through my coursework.
The rest of my code are in private repositories, one for each course, to prevent academic plagiarism. The code in this repository is divided by coding language, and the skill within that language (e.g., R / Data VIsualization).
